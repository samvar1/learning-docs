!!! warning "Be Consistent"
    Nobody claps for discipline
    Nobody cheers for consistency
    But one day, everyone will notice. 
    Show up every day to fix your life. 
    Do it alone. Do it broke. Do it tired. Do it scared. Just do it!


!!! example "Life is Short"
    Normalize pursing the highest version of yourself in all domains of your life. Run fast. Lift heavy. Eat right. Run up your business. Get your mind in order. Treat strangers like freinds, and friends like family. Life is short. Pursue your potential. Inspire others! 

!!! quote "Leadership by the Day"
    1. Have a sense of urgency
    2. Dont touch a piece of paper twice. Complete task there and then
    3. Ask "what is taking your time" eliminate the not essential 
    4. Make positive contribution each day
    5. Don't repeat same mistakes 

!!! quote "Positive Vibes Only"
    'You become what you think about all day long. â€” RALPH WALDO EMERSON

    Your thoughts define who you are and create your reality. That;
    why you should channel your thoughts towards what you
    not what you don't want. As the success expert Brian Tracy
    "The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things uv destre
    not things we fear."
