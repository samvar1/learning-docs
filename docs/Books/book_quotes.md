??? quote "Don't be a Career" 

    The enemy of most dreams and intuitions, and one of the most dangerous and stifling concepts ever invented by humans, is the "Career." There are some big problems here. First and foremost is the notion that your work is different and separate from the rest of your life. If you are passionate about your life and your work, this can't be so. They will become more or less one. This is a much better way to live one's life. The risk factor quotient goes down as you encounter the real world. Many people find what they believe to be safe harbors (lawyers and accountants), only to wake up ten or fifteen years later and discover the price they paid. Make your avocation your vocation. Make what you love your work. The journey is the reward. People think that you've made it when you've gotten to the end of the rainbow and got the pot of gold. But they're wrong. The reward is in the crossing the rainbow. That's easy for me to say—I've got the pot of gold (literally). But if you get the pot of gold, you already know that that's not the reward, and you go looking for another rainbow to cross. Think of your life as a rainbow arching across the horizon of this world. You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, then you disappear.

??? quote "Give it 100%" 
    
    If you're not IØØ percent into it, somebody else who is 100% percent into it will outperform you. And they won't just outperform by a little bit—they'll you outperform you by a lot because now we're operating the domain ideas, interest of compound applies really and really applies. - NAVAL RAVIKANT

??? No Purchase Price to Happiness" 

    A calmn mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things can't be bough. They must be earned - NAVAL RAVIKANT

??? Your Brains job isn't to make you happy" 

    Your brain's primary job is not to make you happy, but to ensure
    your survival. Thus, if you want to be happy, you must take control
    of your emotions rather than hoping you'll be happy because it's
    your natural state.
