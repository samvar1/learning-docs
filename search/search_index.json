So we muststretch ourselves to the very limits of human possibility. Anything less is a sin againstboth God and man -  LEONARDO DA VINCI</p> Don't be a Career <p>The enemy of most dreams and intuitions, and one of the most dangerous and stifling concepts ever invented by humans, is the \"Career.\" There are some big problems here. First and foremost is the notion that your work is different and separate from the rest of your life. If you are passionate about your life and your work, this can't be so. They will become more or less one. This is a much better way to live one's life. The risk factor quotient goes down as you encounter the real world. Many people find what they believe to be safe harbors (lawyers and accountants), only to wake up ten or fifteen years later and discover the price they paid. Make your avocation your vocation. Make what you love your work. The journey is the reward. People think that you've made it when you've gotten to the end of the rainbow and got the pot of gold. But they're wrong. The reward is in the crossing the rainbow. That's easy for me to say\u2014I've got the pot of gold (literally). But if you get the pot of gold, you already know that that's not the reward, and you go looking for another rainbow to cross. Think of your life as a rainbow arching across the horizon of this world. You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, then you disappear.</p> quote \"Give it 100% <p>If you're not I\u00d8\u00d8 percent into it, somebody else who is 100% percent into it will outperform you.
